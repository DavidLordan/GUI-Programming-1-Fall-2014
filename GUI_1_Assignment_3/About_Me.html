            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>Hello, my name is Dave Lordan and I am a new transfer student at the university. I have recently graduated 
                from North Shore Community College with an Engineering Science Transfer degree and I am excited to 
                continue my education at UMass Lowell. Earlier in life I attended Berklee College of Music in 
                Boston as a performance major. I have been working as a professional music teacher for the past nine 
                years, giving private and group lessons in guitar, bass, music theory and arrangement. I am in the 
                midst of changing careers from music to computer science. I have always had a love and appreciation 
                of the arts, sciences, technology, and mathematics. I believe programming, particularly front-end 
                development, is a perfect merging of these fields. I am interested in creating products that 
                combine logical design, functionality, and aesthetics.
            </p>
