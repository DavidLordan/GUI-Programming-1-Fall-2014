      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Dave Lordan and I am a new transfer student at the university. I have recently graduated 
        from North Shore Community College with an Engineering Science Transfer degree and I am excited to 
        continue my education at UMass Lowell. Earlier in life I attended Berklee College of Music in 
        Boston as a performance major. I have been working as a professional music teacher for the past nine 
        years, giving private and group lessons in guitar, bass, music theory and arrangement. I am in the 
        midst of changing careers from music to computer science. I have always had a love and appreciation 
        of the arts, sciences, technology, and mathematics. I believe programming, particularly front-end 
        development, is a perfect merging of these fields. I am interested in creating products that 
        combine logical design, functionality, and aesthetics. </p>

       <!-- Div for navigation section. Includes a basic banner within the h2 tags. The nav_content div will 
       contain links to each of this course's assignments. As of 9/10/14 the only link (assignment 2) navigates
        to this page. As the index evolves, this page as it currently stands will be archived and referenced
