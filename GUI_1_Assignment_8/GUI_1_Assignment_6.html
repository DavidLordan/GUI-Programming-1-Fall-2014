          The purpose of this assignment is to create an interactive and dynamic table.
          A form is used to accept 4 integer inputs from the user which are then used
          to create a multiplication table. The first two integers determine the range
          of multipliers, while the final two integers determine the range of the 
          multiplicands. The user will be allowed to reset the form/table, and/or
          enter new values which will affect the size and content of the table.
          This is to be accomplished using a handful of custom Javascript functions
          as well as functions borrowed from JQuery. 
        
          The page is also stylized using CSS, demonstrating skills that have been
          learned throughout the course.

                starting and ending values of multipliers and multiplicands.
                If an ending value is less than the starting value, the two values
                are swapped. By default all values are zero.
